              ✨happy birthday and happy 1 month anniversary.✨ <br>
              <br>
              yesterday was your day, everything was about celebrating you - the incredible person you are 🎀🎀. now today is our day, we can celebrate us. how far we've come and what
              all happened. all the moments we've spent together. i appreciate you for being a part of my life, and the biggest one at that . you are a really amazing person, with
              the purest of souls, simply your soft touch brightens up everything. your beaming smile always makes me smile and washes over every negative emotion. you have no idea
              of the joy and happiness you bring, not only to me but to others aswell. i have spent exactly 2 months 4 days knowing you and i cherish every moment of it,
              its the best my life's ever been i'm incredibly thankful for you and i'm forever grateful to have you not only as an awesomesauce partner but also as a really good
              friend and as someone i can look upto 💞💞. you inspire me to be stronger, push more everyday. your strength and your resilience is something that makes me respect you
              a lot and i'm uplifted by it. the moments you make really funny jokes with niche references and the way you laugh after, i'm insanely lucky to be able to experience
              that. i remember it later on and no matter where i am i smile and laugh, thinking about your glowing smile. you make life better just with your presence, a presence
              i'm eternally thankful for. your charm and vibrance effortlessly illuminate my world. i didn't think i could care so deeply for anyone until i saw a cut on your hand
              that day and it worried me beyond measure. you deserve all the love and happiness in the world, not just these 2 day but forever 💖💖. and i will spend that forever
              giving it to yo. i'm glad to be a part of your journey, and it slowly melting into our journey. a month has passed by faster than the blink of my eye,
              a day would last forever, but with you it passes by so fast and i wish it didn't. i still cannot believe it has been a month, i can close my eyes and remember colaba
              just like it was yesterday, yet it feels so far away when i think it was a month ago. if time runs this fast with you on earth i suggest we pull an interstellar and go
              to a place opposite to miller's planet, where 7 years would just be 1 hour on earth. although i'm starting to think that might not be enough either. thank you for the
              best month of my life, with all its ups and downs. you are the best thing to ever happen to me and i will honor that. i look forward to our future together 💘💘, with the
              hope time runs slower. i always walk slower with you so we spend longer, but you catch onto that and tell me to walk faster. i will better myself in every way for us.
              i would retrace every step of my life, no matter how big of a mistake i'd made, knowing it will lead to you. everything i considered bad now seems like the best
              possible option since i got to meet you. i hope we have a great year together and do lots of stuff while also managing studies.it's insane how i 
              get to spend time with a literal goddess. thank you for being a part of my life,
              next time we play minecraft i will get even more flowers than last time to show you how thankful i am. i will break their procedural generation looking for flowers to
              show my gratefulness for you 💐💐. (i am so @\\\\\\@ knowing i get to type "together" now) we will have a fun year together. i love you hiya. 💗 <br>
              <br>
              lovingly, <br>
              nukey. <br>
              <br>
              p.s: i had butterflies in my stomach the entire time writing that @\\\\@ <br>
              if you were here in person while i wrote this i would have hugged you and buried you with kisses.

              hi hiya :D <br>
              <br>
              happy 17th birthday! <br>
              <br>
              can't describe how good a friend you are, i've known you for 9 years now (def less cuz like we didnt talk for a huge part of it) 
              and there hasn't been a time where i actually hated you, which is rare because im usually good at hating,
              anyways ur very cool heres 6 big booms -> BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM.According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
              Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
              Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Coming! Hang on a second.
              Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Can you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.
              Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here.
              - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
              - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school.
              Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry.
              - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.
              Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
              That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. 
              - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of... ...9:15. 
              That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick our job today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. 
              Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. 
              Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. 
              This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. 
              Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, 
              scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. 
              - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. 
              These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. 
              - What does that do? - Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Can anyone work on the Krelman? Of course.
              Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. 
              But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. 
              What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? 
              We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! "What's the difference?" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. 
              Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. 
              We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. 
              I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Check it out.
              - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks!
              - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. 
              Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. 
              That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. 
              Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.<br>
